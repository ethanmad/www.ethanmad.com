I'm Ethan Madison, a dentist currently seeking an advanced education in periodontology at The University of Alabama at Birmingham.
I received my Doctor of Dental Surgery degree from University of the Pacific; and previously studied computer science at University of Michigan.

My passions include healthcare, urbanism, Free software, and security and automation.

I run a software-as-a-service business called [bouts.app](https://demo.bouts.app), which aims to help fencing conferences simplify results management and organization.
bouts.app powers the Midwest Fencing Conference. If you're interested in working with us, please click through and reach out!

During my time at Michigan, I was a member of the [fencing team](http://umich.edu/~fencing) on which I served as president and captain and won three national championships.
